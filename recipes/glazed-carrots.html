    <h1>Glazed Carrots</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Glazed carrot sticks coated in a mixture of brown sugar and butter are a 
        versatile side dish you can serve alongside a weeknight meatloaf, a Sunday 
        ham, or your Thanksgiving turkey. These caramelized carrots are a definite 
        kid-pleaser but they're elegant enough to impress the adults as well!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds carrots, peeled and cut into sticks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place carrots into a large saucepan; pour in enough water to reach depth 
            of 1 inch and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer carrots 
            until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in the same saucepan over low heat. Stir in brown sugar, salt, 
            and white pepper until dissolved. Add carrots to the saucepan and toss until 
            coated in the brown sugar mixture. Cook and stir until carrots are heated 
            through and fully coated with glaze, 1 to 3 more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
